yarn add node-sass

webpack and babel will convert sass to css

yarn add react-router-dom

if there are conflicts in version for dependencies
package.json
"resolutions": {
  "babel-jest": "24.7.1"
}

import BrowserRouter in index.js and wrap around <App />

Route
- exact: true or false for exact match
- path: pattern url looking to match
- component

Switch
  Route
  - the moment it sees something match, it will not render the other Routes

props
- history
-- equivalent to use a link but more dynamic
-- can use in componentDidMount
- location: where we are currently, full url
- match

<Link to='/path
- using js to which component to remount/re-render

<button onClick={() => props.history.push('/path)}

match
- allows us to build out nested structure
- it will match the pattern and doesn't care how deeply nested the route is to generate a dynamic path

Route history is only passed into it's first child
- dont prop tunneling
-- passing history down the children til it reaches the child that needs it
-- bad practice cuz there are children that don't need it

withRouter
- higher order component
- function takes a component and transform it into another higherform of itself

export default withRouter(MenuItem)

<div className='directory-menu'>
  { this.state.sections.map(({ title, imageUrl, id, size }) => (
    <MenuItem key={id} title={title} imageUrl={imageUrl} size={size} />
  ))}
</div>
- since the destructured attributes are mapped out the same, we can just use spread
<div className='directory-menu'>
  { this.state.sections.map(({ id, ...otherSectionProps }) => (
    <MenuItem key={id} {...otherSectionProps} />
  ))}
</div>

importing svg
import { ReactComponent as Logo }
- tells create react app that you want a react component that renders SVG rather than its filename
